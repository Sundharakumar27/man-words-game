# Hangman Game - Python
## Overview
This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic game **Hangman**. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player has to guess the word by suggesting letters, with limited attempts. If the player runs out of attempts before correctly guessing the word, they lose. The game features a basic hangman visual with each incorrect guess.

## Features
- Random word selection from a list
- Dynamic display of the word with underscores for unguessed letters
- Hangman visual that updates with each incorrect guess
- Limited attempts for guessing letters
- Input validation to ensure that only single letters are guessed

## How to Play
1. The game will select a random word from a list.
2. You need to guess the letters of the word. For each wrong guess, an attempt is deducted.
3. You can keep track of the remaining attempts and the wordâ€™s progress as underscores and guessed letters.
4. You win if you can guess all the letters of the word correctly before running out of attempts.
5. If you run out of attempts, you lose, and the correct word is revealed.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

### 3. `print_hangman(attempts)`:
- This function displays the hangman image corresponding to the current number of remaining attempts.

### 4. `play_game()`:
